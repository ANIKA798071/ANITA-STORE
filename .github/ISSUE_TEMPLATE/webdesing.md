High-Quality Image/Video: A clean, professional shot of a product in use (e.g., a person wearing a brace) or a short, reassuring video.

2. Product Category Section

This section helps customers quickly navigate to what they need. Use clear visuals and names.

Each category should have a short description and a "Shop Now" button.

Testimonial 2: "I was so worried about my recovery, but this website made it easy to find exactly what I needed. The shipping was so fast!" - Mark S.

6. Informational Content Section

This positions your brand as a helpful resource, not just a seller.

Headline: "Your Guide to Hand Fracture Recovery" or "Learn More."

Links to Blog Posts:

"How to Choose the Right Brace for Your Injury"

"Tips for a Faster Hand Fracture Recovery"

"Understanding Different Types of Hand Fractures"

Key Considerations for Individual Product Pages
Once a customer clicks on a product, the page needs to be even more detailed and reassuring.

High-Resolution Images: Show the product from multiple angles, including how it looks when worn.

Clear Product Name and Price: Right at the top.

Detailed Description: Explain the benefits, not just the features. (e.g., "The soft, breathable material prevents skin irritation..." instead of just "Made of nylon").

Sizing Guide: This is critical. Provide clear instructions on how to measure their hand to find the perfect fit. Use a size chart and an easy-to-understand diagram.

Customer Reviews/Q&A: Show product-specific reviews to build confidence.

"Related Products" Section: Suggest complementary items like hand exercisers or different types of braces.
